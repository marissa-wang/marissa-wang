## About

Hi, I'm a Cognitive Sciences major at UC Irvine. Admittedly new to coding (somewhat) and haven't done much with it yet, but I'm getting there.

I draw, write, read, and play music in my free time. I also have an abnormal fascination and affection for animals, psychological matters, and Russian literature. Anything that involves analysis and the intertwining of heart and brain, I tend to enjoy.
